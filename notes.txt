Notes on Snake code
------------------
src subdirectory has the snake code.
Makefile is hardwired to get the cernlib from JLab CUE system computers
obj subdirectory is used to store object files

Need to modify the Makeifle to get the correct CERNLIB
then do "make" and excutable "snake" is created.

The subdirectory hrs-examples is for the Hall A HRS spectrometer.

In general snake needs a file that described the magnetic system. Usually
one has a trajectory file which sets up the input particle trajectories to go through
the magnetic system. One can also do it interactively.

There is a manual for snake that explains the input files.
One change that I made to the trajectory file is that if one selects a random
distribution then the 
See example below

Example of running code
----------------------
assume that you are running in hrs-examples

define symbolic links for the snake default input file names
ln -s inputfiles/comm_8_dir.dat DIR.DAT
ln -s trajfiles/ran_traj_15cm_20deg.dat TRAJ.DAT
../snake
$ directive-file name??(def=DIR.DAT                                 )
<hit return>

snake will print out each of the HRS magnetic region names

$ data from t(erminal) or d(isk) (def.=t):
d      
( "d" will read from the disk)

$ trajectory-file name?(def=TRAJ.DAT            )
<hit return>
snake prints out information about the input trajectories
Then it prints out how trajectories pass through each region

p(lot),d(isplay),o(utput for mudifi),u(ser defined output)
,r(aytrace style output),n(ew problem),
 m(ove the plot),c(lip the plot),l(ightning),e(nvelope)
s(ection),b(are plot)
v(ctor output)t(rack output) or q(uit)? (def=p)

there is a lot of options (most use the CERNLIB to make plots 
and I avoid those).
I mainly just use.

v(ctor output)
This crates a file fort.31 which has the vector information for the track
at every endplane to track the particle through the magnets even if the track
does not make it to the final endplane.
I wrote a root script macros/make_snake_ntuple.C to convert the fort.31 to a
root file. Need to edit C file to set the root file name 
Then I wrote a root script macros/make_hrs_hist.C which reads the root
  file and plots various plots. The code can also fit matrix elements.
  It makes plots of the X vs Y positions at each endplane defined in the
  input file.
